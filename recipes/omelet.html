        <h1>I can't belive it's still Cake</h1>
        <img src="../images/cake.jpg" alt="Poorly photoshopped I can't believe it's not butter but instead saying still cake">
        <p>This cake is so fantastic, it's hard to believe that's it's still cake. 
            What's so special about it, you might ask, well, 
            this cake has absolutly <strong>no gluten and does not use a cake mix</strong>.
            Gluten intolerance is something that is stressed more and more nowadays, but unfortunately there aren't as many recipes as there should be.
            This changes that. It is also very healthy relative to other cakes. 
            It's all the goodness of cake without the cake mix, read down below to find out how.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li id="strike">Cake Mix</li>
            <li>1 Cup Water</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>3 Eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That's it, it really is that simple. 
            Now you might be thinking to yourself, "boy that's not a cake, that's an effing omelet", but you'd be wrong. 
            In fact that closed-mindedness is exactly why we have these problems. 
            Cake does not have to be cake to be cake. The only problem is your ignorance.
            This is a cake without the cake mix, perfect for celiacs and other gluten intolerent people, and if you can't accept that, you'd better pack up and leave.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the eggs and oil and find an open space to work.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.</li>
            <li>Find a metal or glass pan and pour the oil in as a greaser. You probably will not need the whole 1/2 cup.</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs into the pan.</li>
            <li>Fill the measuring cup with the 1 cup of water. Drink it. We won't be needing it for this recipe, but hydration is really important. Make sure to get at least 8 of those on the daily.</li>
            <li>Stick the cake in the oven and bake for about 14 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your gluten free, anti-cake mix cake!</li>
        </ol>
